2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

## Project Structure

- **Database Creation**: Created a database named `library_db`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_db;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS branch;
CREATE TABLE branch
(
            branch_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            manager_id VARCHAR(10),
            branch_address VARCHAR(30),

);

```

### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
Update members
set member_address = '125 Main St'
where member_id = 'C101';
```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE   issued_id =   'IS121';
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101'
```


**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT 
    ist.issued_emp_id,
    e.emp_name,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS counts
FROM issued_status AS ist
JOIN employees AS e
    ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
GROUP BY 
    ist.issued_emp_id,
    e.emp_name
HAVING COUNT(ist.issued_id) > 1;
```

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_cnts (
    isbn VARCHAR(20),  -- Adjust data types as necessary
    book_title VARCHAR(255),
    no_issued INT
);


INSERT INTO book_cnts (isbn, book_title, no_issued)
SELECT 
    b.isbn,
    b.book_title,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS no_issued
FROM books AS b
JOIN issued_status AS ist
    ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY 
    b.isbn,
    b.book_title;

SELECT * FROM book_cnts;
```


### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

Task 7. **Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

8. **Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT
    b.category,
    SUM(b.rental_price) as Rental_Income,
    COUNT(*)
FROM books as b
JOIN
issued_status as ist
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY category
```

9. **List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= DATEADD(DAY, -180, GETDATE());
```

10. **List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details**:

```sql
SELECT 
    e1.*,
    b.manager_id,
    e2.emp_name as manager
FROM employees as e1
JOIN  
branch as b
ON b.branch_id = e1.branch_id
JOIN
employees as e2
ON b.manager_id = e2.emp_id
```

Task 11. **Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**:
```sql
SELECT *
INTO books_price_greater_than_five
FROM Books
WHERE rental_price > 5;

select * from books_price_greater_than_five
```

Task 12: **Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**
```sql
SELECT 
    DISTINCT ist.issued_book_name
FROM issued_status as ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON ist.issued_id = rs.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL

SELECT * FROM return_status
```

## Advanced SQL Operations

**Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books**  
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's_id, member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.

```sql
SELECT 
    ist.issued_member_id,
    m.member_name,
    bk.book_title,
    ist.issued_date,
    DATEDIFF(DAY, ist.issued_date, GETDATE()) as overdue_days
FROM issued_status ist
JOIN members m
    ON m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
JOIN books bk
    ON bk.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
LEFT JOIN return_status rs
    ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE 
    rs.return_date IS NULL  -- The book has not been returned
    AND 
    DATEDIFF(DAY, ist.issued_date, GETDATE()) > 30  -- More than 30 days overdue
ORDER BY ist.issued_member_id;

```


**Task 14: Update Book Status on Return**  
Write a query to update the status of books in the books table to "Yes" when they are returned (based on entries in the return_status table).


```sql

CREATE PROCEDURE add_return_records
    @p_return_id VARCHAR(10),
    @p_issued_id VARCHAR(10),
    @p_book_quality VARCHAR(10)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @v_isbn VARCHAR(50);
    DECLARE @v_book_name VARCHAR(80);

    -- Insert a new record into the return_status table
    INSERT INTO return_status (return_id, issued_id, return_date, book_quality)
    VALUES (@p_return_id, @p_issued_id, GETDATE(), @p_book_quality);

    -- Retrieve the ISBN and book name from issued_status based on issued_id
    SELECT 
        @v_isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn,
        @v_book_name = ist.issued_book_name
    FROM 
        issued_status ist
    WHERE 
        ist.issued_id = @p_issued_id;

    -- Update the book status to 'yes' in the books table based on the ISBN
    UPDATE books
    SET status = 'yes'
    WHERE isbn = @v_isbn;

    -- Print a message to the user
    PRINT 'Thank you for returning the book: ' + @v_book_name;
END;
GO


-- Test the procedure with sample data
EXEC add_return_records 'RS138', 'IS135', 'Good';
```




**Task 15: Branch Performance Report**  
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, the number of books returned, and the total revenue generated from book rentals.

```sql
SELECT 
    b.branch_id,
    b.manager_id,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS number_book_issued,
    COUNT(rs.return_id) AS number_of_book_return,
    SUM(bk.rental_price) AS total_revenue
INTO branch_reports
FROM issued_status AS ist
JOIN employees AS e
    ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN branch AS b
    ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
LEFT JOIN return_status AS rs
    ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
JOIN books AS bk
    ON ist.issued_book_isbn = bk.isbn
GROUP BY b.branch_id, b.manager_id;

-- Query to retrieve data from the created table
SELECT * FROM branch_reports;
```

**Task 16: CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members**  
Use the CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) statement to create a new table active_members containing members who have issued at least one book in the last 2 months.

```sql

SELECT * 
INTO active_members
FROM members
WHERE member_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT issued_member_id   
    FROM issued_status
    WHERE issued_date >= DATEADD(MONTH, -2, GETDATE())
);

-- Query to retrieve data from the created active_members table
SELECT * FROM active_members;
```


**Task 17: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed**  
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.

```sql
SELECT 
    e.emp_name,
    b.branch_id,
    b.manager_id,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS no_book_issued
FROM issued_status AS ist
JOIN employees AS e
    ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN branch AS b
    ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
GROUP BY e.emp_name, b.branch_id, b.manager_id;
```

**Task 18: Stored Procedure**
Objective:
Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.
Description:
Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. The procedure should function as follows:
The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter.
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes').
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'.
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

```sql

CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE issue_book
    @p_issued_id VARCHAR(10),
    @p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(30),
    @p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(30),
    @p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @v_status VARCHAR(10);

    -- Checking if book is available 'yes'
    SELECT @v_status = status
    FROM books
    WHERE isbn = @p_issued_book_isbn;

    IF @v_status = 'yes'
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO issued_status (issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_date, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
        VALUES (@p_issued_id, @p_issued_member_id, GETDATE(), @p_issued_book_isbn, @p_issued_emp_id);

        UPDATE books
        SET status = 'no'
        WHERE isbn = @p_issued_book_isbn;

        PRINT 'Book records added successfully for book isbn: ' + @p_issued_book_isbn;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Sorry to inform you the book you have requested is unavailable book_isbn: ' + @p_issued_book_isbn;
    END
END;
GO

-- Query to display data from books
SELECT * FROM books;

-- Query to display data from issued_status
SELECT * FROM issued_status;

-- Execute stored procedure
EXEC issue_book 'IS155', 'C108', '978-0-553-29698-2', 'E104';

EXEC issue_book 'IS156', 'C108', '978-0-375-41398-8', 'E104';

-- Query to display data from books for a specific ISBN
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE isbn = '978-0-375-41398-8';

```
